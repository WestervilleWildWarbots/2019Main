We have 12 versions of the autonomous code, 2 for each starting location, one of which is for the cargoship and the other is for the rocket ship and two universal
We will use the one that corresponds to our starting location and strategy based on our alliance
There will be a collapsable dropdown menu on shuffleboard to be selected with the mouse, it will default to CrossLineT1
After autonomous the dropdown goes away and is replaced by a sensor
